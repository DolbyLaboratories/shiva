0x400d8: [foo_v2_second_half]

--

A transform function defined in the patch such as '__shiva_tf_splice_fn_foo'
(Notice it ends in 'foo'). With another function called 'foo' in the same
patch will cause a resolution conflict in the external linking process and
give ambiguous behavior. We need to have a shiva-gcc wrapper for the modules
ideally.
