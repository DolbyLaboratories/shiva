# A document to describe thoughts on performance enhancements

1. Currently Shiva has to analyze every instruction within the .text
to determine where it needs to relocate/relink external instructions
from the target into the patch code, etc. This is the most time consuming
part of Shiva, and can be fixed by implementing this analysis into shiva-ld
the prelinker, and let it generate a new ELF section containing all of the
necessary meta-data for external relinking.

2. We create a PLT entry in the module for every call. If there are 3 separate
calls to a function, then 3 separate PLT entries are created. This creates
a performance hit on runtime linking, and in the runtime post linker too.
